## Unity API


Mike is working on the KinSDK for Android he is using that as a foundation to build the plugin documentation.
Mike provided two readme files so far:  general setup (environment, SDK etc) documentation and a "how to compile the sample app" doc.

Mike stated that Unity developers prefer to look at code examples than reading text-based docs and the Unity docs are going to reflect that.

Andrea to schedule a sync meeting with Mike to get an updated status.
