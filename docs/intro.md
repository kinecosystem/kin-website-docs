Welcome to the Kin Developer's Documentation. It contains everything required for developers to get started with integrating their apps with Kin.

## What is Kin?

Kin is a token on Solana, a consumer-grade blockchain built for scale. It can currently handle 65,000 transactions per second, so it can scale as well as most financial payment systems. Solana transaction times are roughly less < 1 second, making it perfect for the consumer applications of all sizes. Currently transactions made via the Kin SDKs is closer to ~2 seconds, but is being optimized every day. Solana is also extremely decentralized and secure. Read more at http://www.solana.com.

## Available SDKs

All of the SDKs listed below support using Kin.

## Where to start

To effectively integrate the use of Kin into their apps, developers should first familiarize themselves with the high-level [architecture overview](/kin-architecture-overview) and [how the system works](/how-it-works). Those who already have Kin-approved apps can also look to the [SDK migration](/sdk-migration) section for details on what has changed. Those who are new but are ready to get started and register can jump to the [App Registration](/app-registration) section.
